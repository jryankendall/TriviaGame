## About
- TriviaGame is a quiz game made for VB Bootcamp, due February 25th. It utilizes timeouts and intervals in order to track time and give a time limit to the entire quiz. Also, the script uses ajax to get the questions and answers from an API and, based on user's preferences, prints them out in the document dynamically.

## How to use this code
- As this uses an API with ajax, this page only works correctly when a connection to the internet is available. It will not fetch the questions otherwise. In the live environment it is operable.
